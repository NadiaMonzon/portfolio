      <p>
        On my journey on studying an intensive bootcamp, I learned about many
        languages and technologies
      </p>
      <ul className="nes-container with-title is-rounded">
        <h3 className="title">Core</h3>
        <li>
          I started working with HTML5 and CSS3, along with SASS. I learned both
          UI and UX in a superficial way, I learned how to have a proper
          structure to facilitate SEO correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, I learned how to handle JavaScript under ES6 standards, from
          creating events to making requests to the server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not satisfied with this, I jumped into the React pool: migrations,
          JSX, components, lifting, router, hooks?! Basically, an adventure from
          start to finish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Last but not least, Node, Express and SQL arrived to teach me that the
          front end is not everything. That and that I will always have a lot of
          things to learn, this is just the beginning and I still have a long
          way to go.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul className="nes-container with-title is-rounded">
        <h3 className="title">Soft Skills</h3>
        <li>
          I mainly learned software development, but I also learned something
          that I value very much: working as part of a real team.
        </li>
        <li>
          For this, it helped me a lot to learn agile methodologies, more
          specifically Scrum and Kanban. Also, I am very curious about other
          ways of working, such as Xtreme Programming.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also worked with different teams on medium-sized projects and with
          different partners on smaller projects, all remotely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, something that I want to emphasize and that often gets
          forgotten, knowing how to give feedback and how to receive it is a
          super important part of the learning process, and it is something that
          I am very grateful to my bootcamp partners.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul className="nes-container with-title is-rounded">
        <h3 className="title">Learning</h3>
        <li>
          I still have a long way to go, but right now I'm prioritizing learning
          web accessibility, animations with css and I want to start going
          deeper with TypeScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also have on my bucket list to learn how to work on iOS with Swift.
        </li>
